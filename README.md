# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
   What we are trying to achieve with this analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type (Rural, Suburban and Urban). Then we illustrated with a multiple-line graph the total weekly fares for each city type. With this we are able to graphically pinpoint a strategy to follow for the decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results
   What our investigation and compilation of the data yielded the following results:
   
#### 2019 Summary (January 2019 through May 2019)
   From January 1st, 2019 to May 8th of 2019 we saw that the most profitable city type was the urban type, yet due to a high driver count the average fare both per driver and per ride wasn't all that high, the rural fares were higher per driver and per ride. The workload for rural drivers is higher probably due to longer distances/times and a smaller driver count.

#### Q1 Weekly Summary
   By dissecting the 2019 1st quarter by weeks we're able to see that the best performing city type was the urban locations, whereas the rural was the worst performing ones were the rural locations.

#### Q1 Weekly Summary Line Graph
   In this line graph we can more clearly and concisely see what the previous table was trying to say.

## Summary
   With the cold, hard facts in front of us we can discern three things:
   
#### 1. Rural city drivers might be making more money but might be seeing less work.
   Looking at the data it seems that maybe because there's less drivers in rural areas there might be less work yet due to the nature of the terrain distances can be large and the rides long, making it harder for rural areas to get a hold of a driver in times of need. 
#### 2. Trickling down the number of drivers from the urban cities to the suburbs might be a good idea
   Drivers in Metropolitan areas might be having to make more rides in order to make more money, maybe incurring over time and putting in more hours, burning them out and might lead to high driver turnover. Having less drivers in more densely populated areas might make it more profitable both for the drivers and the company. 
#### 3. Suburbs could help service rural areas
   Drivers in suburbs could maybe take a couple of rides in more rural areas helping out the rural city drivers out.
