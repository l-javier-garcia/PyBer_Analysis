# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
 What we are trying to achieve with this analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type (Rural, Suburban and Urban). Then we illustrated with a multiple-line graph the total weekly fares for each city type. With this we are able to graphically pinpoint a strategy to follow for the decision-makers at PyBer.
