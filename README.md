# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
   What we are trying to achieve with this analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type (Rural, Suburban and Urban). Then we illustrated with a multiple-line graph the total weekly fares for each city type. With this we are able to graphically pinpoint a strategy to follow for the decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results
   What our investigation and compilation of the data yielded the following results:
   
   From January 1st, 2019 to May 8th of 2019 we saw that the most profitable city type was the urban type, yet due to a high driver count the average fare both per driver and per ride wasn't all that high, the rural fares were higher per driver and per ride. The workload for rural drivers is higher probably due to longer distances/times and a smaller driver count.

   By dissecting the 2019 1st quarter by weeks we're able to see that the best performing city type was the urban locations, whereas the rural was the worst performing ones were the rural locations.

   In this line graph we can more clearly and concisely see what the previous table was trying to say.
